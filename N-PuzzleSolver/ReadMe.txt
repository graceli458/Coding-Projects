The N-puzzle game consists of a board holding N = m2 − 1 distinct movable tiles, plus one empty space. There is one tile for each number in the set {0, 1,..., m2 − 1}. In this assignment, we will represent the blank space with the number 0 and focus on the m = 3 case (8-puzzle).

In this combinatorial search problem, the aim is to get from any initial board state to the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending order {0, 1,..., m2 − 1} – this is your goal state. The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the initial state. Each move consists of swapping the empty space with a component in one of the four directions {‘Up’, ‘Down’, ‘Left’, ‘Right’}. Give each move a cost of one. Thus, the total cost of a path will be equal to the number of moves made.

Your program will create and/or write to a file called output.txt, containing the following statistics:
1. path to goal: the sequence of moves taken to reach the goal
2. cost of path: the number of moves taken to reach the goal
3. nodes expanded: the number of nodes that have been expanded
4. search depth: the depth within the search tree when the goal node is found
5. max search depth: the maximum depth of the search tree in the lifetime of the algorithm running time: the total running time of the search instance, reported in seconds
6. max ram usage: the maximum RAM usage in the lifetime of the process as measured by the ru maxrss attribute in the resource module, reported in megabytes
